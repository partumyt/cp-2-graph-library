def is_dicotyledonous(graph: dict, directed=False) -> bool:
    """
    Checks the bipartiteness criterion of a graph.
    We start with any vertex, color it with color 0.
    We color its neighbors with color 1, neighbors of neighbors â€” again 0, and so on.
    If at some step we find a vertex that is already colored,
    but has the same color as its neighbor, the graph is not bipartite.

    The function supports both directed and undirected graphs.
    
    :param graph (dict): Graph represented as an adjacency list.
    :param directed (bool): Whether to consider the graph as directed.

    Returns:
    - bool: True if the graph is bipartite, False otherwise.
